            <h3>Project One</h3>
            <p>This project involved creating a low-fi wireframes for a personal portfolio website and I would say it was a complete success having had the opportunity to learn so much about Figma.</p>

            <h3>Project Two</h3>
            <p>This project involed converting the low-fi wireframes into high-fi wireframes and ultimately converting them into interactive prototypes, a project which in my opinion I executed effortlessly using Figma</p>
